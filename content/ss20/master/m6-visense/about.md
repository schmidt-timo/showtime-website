{{<section title="Project Goals">}}
1. web application for visualization of IoT sensor data in building models
2. anomaly detection analysis of measured values by calculating gradients and defining limit values for each sensor
3. timeline chronological monitoring and comparison of sensor data
4. mesh coloring colored representation of the measured values on sensor meshes in the 3D model
5. sensor meshes documentation of sensor locations in the 3D model
