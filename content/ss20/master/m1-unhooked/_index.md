{{<section title="Description">}}
Why do mobile applications take so much of our time? Why do we spend every free minute on our smartphones? Why do we find these applications so tempting that every time the smartphone flashes, we pick it up and leave everything else behind. Then we get engrossed with the smartphone and we forget everything around us.

Why can applications and social media applications do something that seems to cast a spell on us?

We have developed a mobile web e-learning application that addresses exactly these points and explains these mechanisms.

It's "unhooked"!
