Cargobike Adventures is an operating e-commerce web app that solves a problem that a lot of us are experiencing in this pandemic. In a time when booking flights is irresponsible, and even taking public transportation is risky, more and more people are drawn to taking road trips. But for those without a driver license or those who are **health and environment conscious**, an **e-cargobike trip** is the best option out there! Through the site, users gain access to top-notch e-bikes that were remodeled with a cargo to fit either camping gears or safely bring young kids along. Users can customize your rental order by choosing the add-ons provided by us, be it quick inflatable tent, cooking gear, SUP board, slack line, or the insurance plan that suits you best. That's not it, users can also check out **recommended routes, write an inquiry message, or purchase a gift card** for their adventurous loved ones.

{{<section title="Our Goals">}}
As developers, we set out to satisfy both the users and business owners. For the users, we built a simple, informative, responsive, and safe e-commerce site that provides as many features as it can to help them plan an e-bike tour.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
We are not only providing a solution for COVID traveling but we ourselves are also overcoming remote team work. Thanks to amazing collaboration tools, we were able to hold meetings at least twice a week and actively participate in planning, designing, and revising. Our team consists of 4 members and 2 project leaders, it is small yet ambitious. As for job assignment, we started out with a clear role assignment, but as time went on, we worked as a team and have helped each other out with different tasks, so everyone has dipped their toes in different fields and contributed whatever they could to our project.
