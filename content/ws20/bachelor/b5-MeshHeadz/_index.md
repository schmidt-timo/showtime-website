{{<section title="Context">}}
Hearing loss is a condition that can cause various problems, including the loss of the ability to identify the location of a sound, also called **binaural hearing**. 

To help people with this condition, the **possibility to train binaural hearing was researched at HTW Berlin**. 
One possible approach to a solution was to manipulate an audio signal in a way that the location of a sound can be determined using conventional stereo headphones. 

Considering that **the localization of sound is significantly influenced by the individual shape of the ear and head**, it is necessary to incorporate that in the manipulation of the audio signal.

Since nowadays nearly everyone has a smartphone in their pocket and cameras and photogrammetry software are continuously improved, we wanted to take the initiative to develop an **easily handleable mobile application prototype to optimize head measurement**.

After a short period of understanding, each of our five team members quickly found their preferred area of working. Fundamentally, the project was divided into three subgroups: 

* The **App** team
* The **Web Service** team
* The **3D-Pipeline** team
 
Since all groups communicated with each other on a regular basis, in the end, we always knew about each other’s issues and achievements and shared our expertise with the team.
Eventually each team member became an expert in their respective field.
