{{<section title="Development">}}
Our virtual reality safety training prototype was developed with the **Unity (2019.4.12f1)** game engine. To make use of already implemented basic VR interactions, the **SteamVR (1.2.3)** plugin as well as the **Virtual Reality Toolkit (3.3.0)** were chosen.
Furthermore, previous developing experience of some group members made it possible to apply past knowledge while shortening learning time.

{{<section title="Hardware">}}
The application was developed targeting and using the **HTC Vive VR headset**.

{{<section title="Modeling">}}
Various programs were used for modeling but **Blender (2.91)** took the main stage due to its open source approach and the widely available resources for learners.
Along with the core features, free plugins were used, especially for proper model texturing.

For the modeling of the player hands **ZBrush** and **GIMP** were used additionally.

The project setup as well as code versioning were made possible for us via a **GitLab** self-hosted solution by the project supervisors.

{{<section title="Communication">}}
Starting off with **Slack** we quickly changed to **Discord** as our primarly internal communication channel, due to overall accesability and comfort.

Calls with the project partners or weekly catch up meetings with the project supervisors were held via **Zoom**.
